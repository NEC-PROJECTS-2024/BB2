INTRODUCTION
India's economy and livelihoods are heavily intertwined with agriculture, with over 60% of its population relying directly or indirectly on this sector. Recognizing the significance of agriculture, there's a growing emphasis on implementing advanced technologies like the crop recommendation system. This system is pivotal in guiding farmers on which crops to cultivate based on various factors such as soil composition, weather patterns, humidity levels, rainfall forecasts, and other pertinent variables. By leveraging data-driven insights, this system aims to optimize agricultural output and mitigate risks associated with crop failures. The benefits extend beyond individual farmers, contributing to the nation's overall food security and stability by helping to stabilize food costs and ensure a reliable supply of agricultural products. Thus, the crop recommendation system emerges as a vital tool in fostering sustainable agricultural practices and bolstering India's agricultural economy.
